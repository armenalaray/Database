# EagleFly

Hello Everyone, and welcome to EagleFly!, a user mode debugger for Windows coded from scratch

This is the repo for the whole project, EagleFly is intended to be a fast and reliable user mode debugger, for Windows. 
The project comes with recordings of each coding session, so you can watch them as we go!

The debugger is meant to have debugging essentials, Watch windows, (Source, dissasembly, memory) views, breakpoint inspection. 
It is planned to be reliable and save userÂ´s state, so that you could reload sessions when launching, 
and fast so we can supersede Visual Studio's debugger. =)

The series started on June 7th 2018. And we will take as much time as necessary to finish. 
The project is on the initial stages, right now I'm parsing PDB's for symbol extraction, and implementing the debug tracer loop.

If you want to build the project you should modify the build.bat that is inside eaglefly/code/ 
so that you can build from the directory where you put the project into. (I'm looking forward to simplify this!).
